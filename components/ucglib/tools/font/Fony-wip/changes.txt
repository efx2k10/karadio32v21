 IMPROVEMENTS:
 * User interface revamp - now most things are dockable toolbars.
   (Customizable, too - see View->Customize Toolbars.)
 * Glyph selector has a context menu now.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.4.0 alpha:

2009-04-26:
 * Finally found and fixed the tiny (and stupid) but fatal bug which caused
   Fony to calculate invalid offsets for the FON header, causing havoc with
   large font files.
 * BDF Export dialog with the option to export glyphs without trimming off
   padding from glyph edges, to get around faulty bounding box calculations
   of some programs.
 * BDF Import asks whether to preserve or crop glyphs with invalid width.
 * Exporting a bitmap in Bitmap Font Writer format ignored range settings.
 * Importing a TTF font made buttons in confirmation dialogs use said font.
 * "Install font" should now install font permanently (on XP and below).
 * Glyph ranges can now also be selected with the middle mouse button.
 * Made the brush alpha-blended for a nicer look.
 * Small improvements, nicer easter egg(?)

2009-02-13:
 * Made it possible to select a range of glyphs by depressing Shift while
   clicking on the glyph list bar. Effects such as Invert, Mirror, Boldify
   now apply to the range of glyphs selected, if applicable. If no range is
   selected, they apply to either the current glyph or the whole font,
   depending on whether Shift is pressed.
   Works with copy/paste too, but not much error checking yet.

2009-01-13:
 * test/Fony.exe: Opening the Properties dialog for a font with multiple
   VarFileInfo (or any other) blocks no longer results in a crash.

2009-01-05:
 * test/Fony.exe: Improvements to BDF importing

2008-10-22:
 * Line tool now too supports larger than 1 pixel brushes.
 * Custom mouse cursors for the editor window. Hope they don't suck too much?
 * "Boldify font" could set font width wrong on monospaced fonts.
 * There was no way to convert a monospaced font to a variable pitch one
   without accepting the "Crop Width" dialog.
 * Fixed a graphical glitch with the brush after resizing glyph/font.
 * Added links to Fony website and forum on the Help menu.

2008-10-18:
 * Finally implemented brushes bigger than 1px! (Not for the Line tool, yet.)
 * Brush follows mouse. (Will be made optional later.)
 * Custom bitmap importer: you can now import by either text color or
   background color (anything in chosen color is text vs. anything in
   chosen color is background).
 * Fixed behaviour of Escape button in question/confirmation dialogs (it
   triggered Yes/OK instead of Cancel).

2008-10-17:
 * "Boldify font" feature (remember to set font properties after using it)
 * Further improved custom bitmap importer: pan the image by holding down
   the middle mouse button; right-click to pick text color; displays glyph
   bounds; made the dialog resizable and non-modal so you can modify the
   glyphs while working; selection height was off by one pixel; zooming
   centers in on selection; bounds checking.

2008-10-16:
 * Custom bitmap import; grab glyphs from any image with some text written in
   a fixed-width font. (Create or load a fixed-width font before importing
   and set its size to the size of the font in the image. Should be simple to
   understand. Threshold is for use when all pixels of the text are not the
   same exact color; good for JPEGs and such. Arrow keys fine tune position.)

2008-05-27:
 * View menu is now functional.
 * Fixed tab order in some dialogs.

2008-05-23:
 * Oops, changes to Module name and Description strings were ignored.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 1.3.6: (2008-05-22)

 ADDITIONS:
 * Preliminary support for Version resources in FON.
 * Install/uninstall font.
 * Proper font cropping (Edit -> Crop Width).
 * Drag'n'drop support.
 * "Use old method to save Win3.x FNT files" for possibly(?) better
   compatibility. (Win2.x format is always saved using this method.)

 IMPROVEMENTS:
 * Hugely improved FNT/FON output; Windows 9x and Softy shouldn't choke on
   Fony-generated fonts anymore.
 * Moved glyph selector from editor window to main window.
 * Uses proper dialog font on Windows 9x.
 * Other user interface and cosmetics enhancements.

 BUG FIXES:
 * Only first font resource was saved in FON.
 * After a "Save As" to FNT, subsequent saves still saved as FON.
 * Font charset combobox always defaulted to "Other:".
